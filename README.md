# Logos Keyboard Project
- Zmk wired split keyboard based on the XIAO RP2040 module
Each side features:
- 3x6 but with a reduced pink cluster (no keys on pinky row 2)
- slight splay on the ring finger, strong splay on the pinky cluster
- 2 thumb keys extended further away from the palm than standard designs like the corne, so that the index and thumb never cross over.
